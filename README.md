# Learning-Log
Wrote a web app called Learning Log that allows users to log the topics they've interested in and make journal entries as they learn about each topic. Link: https://main-bvxea6i-7od24jcfntl4e.us-3.platformsh.site/
The learning log home page describe the site and invite users to either register or log in the account.
Once logged in, a user can create new topics, edit the topics, add new entries, edit the old entries.
Used Bootstrap 5 for giving some styling to the websites and used Django to wrote the web app.
Used Platform.sh free-tier service to deploy the website at the above provided link.
I really want to thank **Eric Matthes** and his Book **Python Crash Course** which helped me in building this website.
